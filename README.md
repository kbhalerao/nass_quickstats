# A SvelteKit clone of NASS QuickStats

USDA NASS provides a data browser called [QuickStats](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/).

This is a SvelteKit clone of that web service, which uses USDA's [API](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api) internally.

This is a demonstration project to be turned into a small component library.
